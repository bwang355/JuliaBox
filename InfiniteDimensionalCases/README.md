# Infinite-Dimensional Optimization Case Studies
This repository contains the source-code Julia scripts used in the case studies 
featured in the manuscript "A Unifying Framework for Modeling Infinite-Dimensional 
Optimization Problems" by Joshua L. Pulsipher, Weiqi Zhang, Tyler J. Hongisto, 
and Victor M. Zavala.

## Implementation
First, you'll need to install Julia (available at https://julialang.org/downloads/).
Then you'll find instructions about running each case study on the `README.md` 
file within each case study folder.
