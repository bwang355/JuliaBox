## Supporting Information Tests

The scripts in this folder are for the Supporting Information. 
 * `networkx_storage.ipynb` - NetworkX analysis for allocations for storing data on graphs
 * `matlab_graphs.m` - Matlab graph object analysis for allocations for storing data on graphs
 * `metagraphs_allocations.jl` - MetaGraphs.jl and PlasmoData.jl analysis for allocation for storing data on graphs
 * `LC_SVMs_SI.jl` - Julia script for analyzing performance of different modeling decisions on grayscale LC data
 * `LC_SMVs_SI_3channel.jl` - Julia script for analyzing performance of different modeling decisions on RGB LC data

The `NetworkX` analysis was done with Python version 3.8.5 and NetworkX version 2.5.
